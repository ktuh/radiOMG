    <p>
      <span class='copy__caps'>KTUH </span> is staffed almost entirely by University of Hawaiʻi at Manoa
      students, so this is your chance to be on the air and learn a thing or two
      about the behind-the-scenes magic that goes into running a 24-hour,
      7-day-a-week radio station.

      Due to the number of students interested in being on the air, it may take
      three months to a year before an applicant is called in for training,
      depending on the length of the waiting list and the amount of station
      turnover.
